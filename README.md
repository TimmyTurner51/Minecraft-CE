# Minecraft-CE
A 3D Minecraft clone for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator.
***IMPORTANT!!***
Don't set render distance and/or LOD too high (~7-8 blocks) on real hardware!
This makes your calc lag due to rendering so much, it can't handle the current implementation.


Pre-Alpha v6.14.25a2 release notes:
- Working hotbar
- Place blocks
- Destroy blocks
- You are given an empty slot, grass, dirt, tree log, tree leaves by default.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current features other than release notes:

- 16x16x16 chunk available to test around in
